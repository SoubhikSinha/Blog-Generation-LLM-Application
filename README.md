## About the Project
This project provides hands-on experience with Meta's [Llama-2](https://www.llama.com/llama2/) model. The goal is to develop a **Streamlit application for blog generation**, allowing users to effortlessly generate blog content.

### Features:
-   Users can input a **blog topic**, specify the **word count**, and define the **target audience**.
-   The application then generates a well-structured blog based on the given inputs.

Since the full **Llama-2** model is massive, we use a [compressed version of Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin) for simplicity and efficiency.
